# Avalanchemodule 4

In this project , we have created a token and deployed to the avalanche network.

## Description

This program lets us create a new token called Degen and we are able to explore different functionalities which can be implemented using this token.
We can also deploy it onto the Avalanche network using the injected provider-metamask.

1.Fork the repository or download the zip file.

2.Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
npm install
```


3.Explore the available tasks that can be run using Hardhat by running the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat help
```

4.Run the tests for the code using the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

5.Start a local development network using the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

6.Deploy the smart contract to the Avalanche network by running the deployment script:
